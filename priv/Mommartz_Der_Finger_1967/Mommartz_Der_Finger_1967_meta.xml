  <description>With Günther Uecker and Brigitte Stöckhert
Male finger between two female fingers. Addicional eroctic giggling.

In "The Finger" we see a male finger moving between two female fingers; with that the giggeling of a woman and a man. A film of sensual touch with all its related associations.
